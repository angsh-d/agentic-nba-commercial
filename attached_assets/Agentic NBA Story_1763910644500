The Dr. Sarah Smith Story: Why Traditional NBAs Missed the Mark
The Surface-Level Alert (Traditional Approach)
In October 2025, Dr. Sarah Smith appeared on the traditional NBA dashboard with a concerning signal:

✅ Memorial Sloan Kettering oncologist (tier-1 institution)
✅ High engagement (10-month relationship, regular visits)
⚠️ Competitor gaining share: +15%
✅ Low churn risk score: 15/100
Traditional NBA System Output:

"Recommended Action: Schedule clinical lunch-and-learn to review latest product efficacy data. Priority: Medium."

The field rep followed the recommendation. Dr. Smith was polite, engaged, but the switching continued. Why did this fail?

What Traditional NBAs Missed: The Hidden Causal Story
Dr. Smith didn't have "one switching problem" — she had two distinct, evidence-driven switching patterns happening simultaneously across different patient cohorts:

Pattern 1: Young RCC Cohort (Ages 46-54)

5 patients switched to Onco-Rival between July 3-August 1, 2025
Causal trigger: ASCO ORION-Y trial results (June 15, 2025) showing 40% PFS benefit in patients <55
Dr. Smith's decision: Systematic, evidence-based adoption for her younger RCC patients
Pattern 2: Cardiovascular Risk Cohort (Ages 59-72)

4 patients with cardiac comorbidities (CAD, prior MI, CHF, stroke) switched in September 2025
Causal triggers:
Three cardiac adverse events in Dr. Smith's own patients (August 2025: QT prolongation, arrhythmia, chest pain)
Onco-Rival cardiac safety webinar (August 30, 2025)
Dr. Smith's decision: Safety-driven defensive switching to protect high-risk patients
Pattern 3: Stable Cohort

3 patients remained on Onco-Pro (bladder, ovarian, prostate cancer patients without CV risk or RCC)
Why no switch? Neither the efficacy signal (wrong indication) nor safety concern (no CV risk) applied
Why Traditional NBAs Failed
Traditional rule-based NBA systems would have:

Aggregated the signal: "9 of 12 patients switched → Dr. Smith is churning"
Applied generic tactics: "Schedule meeting, show efficacy data"
Missed the causality: No understanding of why different cohorts switched at different times
Wrong intervention timing: Recommended action after both causal events already occurred
One-size-fits-all: Same recommendation regardless of underlying root causes
The field rep walks in with a generic efficacy deck when Dr. Smith has already made two sophisticated, evidence-based decisions for different clinical reasons.

The Agentic NBA Approach: Multi-Hypothesis Causal Investigation
The Agentic NBA Platform deployed four specialized AI agents in sequence:

1. Hypothesis Generator Agent
Generated competing causal hypotheses:

"Conference-driven efficacy shift for RCC subgroup"
"Safety-driven switching post-adverse events"
"Competitor marketing campaign"
"Formulary/payer changes"
2. Evidence Analyst Agent
Gathered timestamped evidence from multiple sources:

FDA FAERS database (cardiac AE reports trending up 340% in Q3)
ASCO conference archives (ORION-Y abstract, June 15)
Dr. Smith's own patient cohort (3 cardiac AEs in August)
Prescription timeline showing two distinct switching waves
3. Pattern Synthesizer Agent
Connected temporal correlations:

Young RCC switches cluster immediately after ASCO (July)
CV-risk switches cluster immediately after cardiac AEs + webinar (September)
Stable cohort unaffected → indicates strategic, not categorical switching
4. Recommender Agent
Generated a cohort-specific, causally-informed NBA:

"Host an on-site 60-90 minute CME-aligned 'Cardio-Oncology Tumor Board & Rapid Case Review' at MSK with:

Cardiology co-management expert to address CV-risk patient safety concerns
Peer KOL to present nuanced ORION-Y subgroup data and patient selection criteria
Pre-pull 8-12 of Dr. Smith's patients to review live cases
Establish cardiac monitoring protocol and standing cardiology consult workflow
Activate fast-track PA team with <10 business day SLA"
Why the Agentic Approach Wins
Traditional NBA	Agentic NBA
"Competitor gaining share"	"Two distinct causal drivers: efficacy (young RCC) + safety (CV risk)"
Generic lunch-and-learn	Cohort-specific tumor board with cardiology + KOL
Reactive (after switches)	Proactive (addresses root causes to prevent further attrition)
No hypothesis testing	Multi-hypothesis causal investigation with evidence scoring
One-size-fits-all	Tailored to Dr. Smith's specific patient mix and clinical decision drivers
30-minute pitch	90-minute collaborative clinical session with operational support
The Outcome Story
With the agentic approach, the field rep arrives at MSK with:

Clinical credibility: "I understand you switched young RCC patients post-ORION-Y, and CV-risk patients after the cardiac AEs — both were evidence-based decisions."
Targeted solutions:
For CV-risk patients: Cardiac monitoring protocols + cardiology co-management
For young RCC: Nuanced patient selection criteria showing when Onco-Pro still wins
Operational support: Fast-track PA team to remove access friction
Dr. Smith sees a partner who understands her clinical decision-making, not a vendor pushing product.

The Bottom Line:
Traditional NBAs see "switching." Agentic NBAs see "strategic, evidence-driven clinical decision-making across distinct patient cohorts with temporal causal triggers." That difference drives retention.
