## AI-Powered Root Cause Investigation for Prescription Switching

---

## SLIDE 1: Problem → Solution

**The Gap Reps Face Today**
• HCPs switched to competitors—but WHY is buried in scattered data
• Hours manually investigating each case across CRM, claims, call notes, payer docs
• Existing NBA systems say WHAT to do, not WHY → blind execution, low confidence

**Our Solution: Autonomous AI Investigation in <1 Minute**
• Multi-agent system analyzes 18 connected data sources via knowledge graph
• Identifies root cause with 95% confidence + evidence chain
• Auto-generates contextual call scripts tailored to the specific situation

**Not analytics. Not alerts. Autonomous investigation that explains the WHY.**

## SLIDE 2: How We Augment Your RL/Rules NBA Systems

**Transparency: Reps See the WHY Behind the WHAT**
• Evidence chain: "Aug 1 policy → $800 copay → 9 patient switches"
• Complete reasoning visible → reps trust the action → execute with conviction

**Contextuality: NBAs Tailored to Root Cause**
• Access barrier ≠ safety concern → different scripts, objections, messaging
• Reps can guide: "Check publications" → agents recompute with new signals
• Situation-specific execution materials, not generic templates

**Demo Proof: Dr. Chen Case**
• 44% Rx decline → AI found: multi-payer Tier 3 policy change (Aug 1)
• 100% correlation proven → Benefits Investigation NBA (91% effectiveness)
• Total time: 53 seconds from HCP selection to ready-to-use call script

**Result:** Your existing engines deliver better outcomes when fed validated root causes and contextual execution
