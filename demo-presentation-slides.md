# Agentic NBA Platform Demo
## AI-Powered Prescription Intelligence for Pharmaceutical Field Teams

---

## Slide 1: The Challenge
### What Field Reps Face Today

**The Problem:**
- HCPs have already switched to competitors, but reps don't know why
- 44% prescription declines are visible in the data, but root causes are hidden
- Hundreds of data signals (call notes, payer policies, clinical events) scattered across systems
- Reps spending hours manually investigating each switching event
- No clear path from "Dr. X switched" to "Here's exactly why and what to do"

**The Cost:**
- Unable to address root causes effectively
- Trial-and-error engagement strategies
- Wasted time on wrong interventions
- Same switches happening to other HCPs in the territory

## Slide 2: Introducing Agentic NBA Platform
### AI Agents That Think Like Your Best Commercial Analyst

**What It Does:**
Multi-agent AI system that automatically:
1. **Detects** prescription switching patterns in real-time
2. **Investigates** root causes using 18 data sources
3. **Recommends** specific Next Best Actions with evidence
4. **Generates** ready-to-use call scripts and emails

**The Difference:**
- Not just analytics dashboards
- Not just alerts
- Autonomous AI agents working 24/7 to protect your market share

## Slide 3: Four-Stage AI Workflow
### See Agents Reason in Real-Time

**Stage 1: Observe & Correlate (15 seconds)**
- Signal Detector analyzes 8 months of prescription data
- NLP Analyzer processes field call notes
- Document Parser reviews payer communications
- Correlation Engine identifies temporal patterns

**Stage 2: Investigate Causality (18 seconds)**
- Hypothesis Generator creates competing theories
- Evidence Gatherer cross-references patient switches
- Hypothesis Tester validates root causes
- Confidence Scorer provides 95%+ certainty ratings

**Stage 3: Synthesize Recommendations (20 seconds)**
- LLM Engine generates strategic recommendations
- RL-based NBA Engine scores by historical effectiveness
- Rules Engine validates compliance guardrails
- Ensemble ranks top actions by composite score

**Stage 4: Execute**
- Auto-generates personalized call scripts
- Creates email drafts with objection handling
- Provides field-ready tactical playbooks

## Slide 4: Demo Scenario - Dr. Michael Chen
### Real-World Use Case: Access Barrier Detection

**The Situation:**
- Dr. Chen prescribed 45 Onco-Pro scripts in May
- Dropped to 25 scripts by October (44% decline)
- 9 patients switched to competitors
- Risk Score: 92/100 (Critical)

**What Our AI Discovered:**
- Root Cause: August 1st multi-payer policy changes
- 4 major payers moved Onco-Pro to Tier 3
- Created $800+ copay shock for patients
- 100% correlation between policy date and switch patterns

**The Recommendation:**
Benefits Investigation Service with Hub enrollment
- 91% composite effectiveness score
- Addresses copay barriers directly
- Proven 79% success rate in similar cases

## Slide 5: How We Augment Your Existing NBA Systems
### The Missing Layer: Autonomous Root Cause Investigation

**Your Current NBA Stack:**
- **RL-based Systems:** Recommend actions based on historical effectiveness patterns
- **Rules-based Systems:** Apply compliance guardrails and commercial policies
- **Gap:** Both assume you already know WHY the HCP switched

**What We Add On Top:**
1. **Autonomous Investigation Layer**
   - AI agents investigate WHY across 18 connected data sources (knowledge graph)
   - Connects scattered signals: patient switches → payer policies → clinical events → HCP networks
   - Delivers root cause with 95% confidence in <1 minute

2. **Explainability & Human Guidance**
   - Shows complete reasoning chain with temporal evidence
   - Reps can guide investigation: "Check clinical publications"
   - Validates causality before passing to your existing NBA engines

3. **Production-Ready Execution**
   - Auto-generates field-ready call scripts with objection handling
   - Integrates with your existing RL/Rules engines for final NBA selection
   - Provides the "why" context that makes your NBAs more effective

**The Value:**
- **Enhances** your existing investments (doesn't replace them)
- **Feeds** validated root causes to your RL/Rules engines
- **Improves** NBA effectiveness by ensuring the right action for the right reason
