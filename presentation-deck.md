# Agentic NBA Platform
## AI-Powered Prescription Intelligence

---

## SLIDE 1: The Problem
**Reps Know HCPs Switched—But Not Why**

• 44% prescription declines visible in data, root causes hidden
• Scattered signals across CRM, claims, call notes, payer docs
• Hours spent manually investigating each switching event
• Trial-and-error engagement with no clear action path

**Result:** Wasted time, ineffective interventions, recurring switches

---

## SLIDE 2: Our Solution
**Autonomous AI Agents Investigate Root Causes in <1 Minute**

• Multi-agent system analyzes 18 connected data sources
• Identifies WHY HCPs switched using knowledge graph reasoning
• Delivers validated root cause with 95% confidence
• Auto-generates contextual call scripts and email drafts

**Not analytics. Not alerts. Autonomous investigation.**

---

## SLIDE 3: How It Works
**Four-Stage AI Workflow (53 Seconds Total)**

**Stage 1: Observe (15s)**
Signal detection across Rx data, call notes, payer policies

**Stage 2: Investigate (18s)**
Hypothesis testing with evidence validation

**Stage 3: Synthesize (20s)**
Ensemble ranking: LLM creativity × RL effectiveness × Rules compliance

**Stage 4: Execute**
Generate call script with objection handling

## SLIDE 4: Demo Case
**Dr. Michael Chen – Access Barrier Detection**

**Situation:**
• 45 → 25 Onco-Pro scripts (44% decline)
• 9 patients switched to competitors
• Risk Score: 92/100

**AI Investigation Found:**
• Root Cause: Aug 1 multi-payer policy changes → Tier 3 placement
• Evidence: 100% correlation between policy date and switches
• Impact: $800+ copay shock across 4 payers

**Recommendation:**
Benefits Investigation Service (91% effectiveness score)

## SLIDE 5: Augments Your Existing NBA Systems
**Transparency + Contextuality = Better Outcomes**

**The Gap:**
RL/Rules engines tell reps WHAT to do, not WHY → blind execution

**What We Add:**

**1. Transparency**
• Root cause with evidence chain visible
• Reps understand situation → execute with confidence

**2. Contextuality**
• NBA tailored to specific root cause (access ≠ safety)
• Reps guide investigation: "Check publications"
• Situation-specific scripts and objection handling

**Result:** Your existing engines work better with validated root causes
