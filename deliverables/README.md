## The Story

The deliverables tell the story of Dr. Sarah Smith, a Memorial Sloan Kettering oncologist whose 75% patient switching rate appeared as a simple "competitor gaining share" alert in traditional NBA systems. 

The Agentic NBA Platform uncovered the hidden truth: **two distinct, evidence-driven switching patterns** across different patient cohorts:

1. **Young RCC patients (5)** switched in July-August following ASCO ORION-Y trial data
2. **CV-risk patients (4)** switched in September after experiencing cardiac adverse events

Traditional NBAs recommended a generic lunch-and-learn. The Agentic approach generated a cohort-specific CME-aligned Cardio-Oncology Tumor Board with cardiology experts and peer KOLs—delivering clinical credibility instead of product pitch.

## Data Sources

All metrics and visualizations are based on actual data from the Agentic NBA Platform database:
- 12 total patients under Dr. Smith's care
- 9 switched to competitor (75% switch rate)
- 3 remained on Onco-Pro (stable cohort)
- Prescription timeline: May-October 2025
- Clinical events: ASCO conference (Jun 15), Cardiac AEs (Aug), Safety webinar (Aug 30)

## Design Philosophy

Both deliverables follow Apple's design language:
- **Greyscale palette** with minimal use of color
- **Generous whitespace** for focus and clarity
- **Clean typography** using system fonts
- **Uncluttered layouts** prioritizing content over decoration
- **Premium feel** through simplicity and precision
